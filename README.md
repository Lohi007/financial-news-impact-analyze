##  Design Decisions
1. Modular Agent Architecture
Each agent is implemented as a standalone class with a focused responsibility:
> SentimentAgent for tone classification
> EntityExtractionAgent for company/ticker identification
> ImpactPredictionAgent for market movement prediction
> SummaryAgent for human-readable output

2. Typed Interfaces with Pydantic
Inputs and outputs of all agents are defined using BaseModel from Pydantic, allowing structured validation and smooth handoffs between agents.

3. Rule-Based Heuristics in Place of Prompts
Since pydantic_ai and LLM APIs were not usable in the test environment, all agents rely on hardcoded logic and keyword matching. These can later be swapped out with LLM-based prompt templates.

4. Simple NLP for Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment classification relies on keyword heuristics ("record profits", "loss", "concern", etc.) to approximate real-world tone without relying on an AI model.

5. String-Template Summary Generation
The SummaryAgent uses f-strings to simulate prompt output, structured similarly to how a language model might respond to a summarization request.

6. Inline Evaluation Framework
Evaluation logic is included directly in the main script to simplify testing. All five articles from the case study are processed end-to-end to demonstrate system performance.

## Prompt Iteration / Logic Refinement
Although no actual prompt templates were used due to the environment, the agent logic was refined iteratively in the same spirit as prompt tuning. Below is a breakdown:

## Agent	                       Iteration	               Changes Made
SentimentAgent	              V1 → V2	      Added more nuanced financial keywords like "beats                                              expectations" and "concern"
EntityExtractionAgent	        V1 → V2	      Expanded static detection to include CureGen,                                                  ByteDance, and FirstState
ImpactPredictionAgent	        V1 → V2	      Originally returned just the direction — added                                                 reason for explainability
SummaryAgent	                V1 → V2	      Trimmed down output to match submission                                                        expectations (no sentiment/companies)
