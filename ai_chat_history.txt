✅ The starter code for all 4 agents has been generated and organized using Pydantic AI conventions. Here's what's included:

SentimentAgent: Classifies news as positive/negative/neutral

EntityExtractionAgent: Extracts companies and tickers

ImpactPredictionAgent: Predicts short-term market reaction

SummaryAgent: Summarizes the result in a readable report

You can now wire them together in your main.py, and I can help generate that too — along with:

📂 requirements.txt

📄 README.md template

🧪 evaluation.py for 5 test cases

Let me know what you'd like next!

Edited
✅ The code has been updated to remove the unavailable pydantic_ai dependency and replaced with mock agent classes using placeholder logic. Each agent now has a .run() method you can use to simulate behavior.

Would you like help wiring these together in a main.py orchestrator or building out your README.md?

Edited
✅ The code has been fully rewritten to remove the pydantic_ai dependency and is now using basic Python logic with mock inference. A working example has also been added at the bottom for quick testing and debugging.

Would you like help writing the orchestration flow in main.py or preparing your README.md documentation next?

Edit
Headline: Tesla crushes Q3 expectations with record profits, but Musk warns of 'turbulent t
Sentiment Analysis: Positive
Affected Companies: Tesla
Predicted Market Impact: Up
Explanation:
The phrase "record profits" triggers the SentimentAgent to label the sentiment as positive.

"Tesla" is recognized in the content, so it's extracted as a company with ticker TSLA.

The ImpactPredictionAgent maps positive sentiment to "up".

The SummaryAgent formats these into a final report.

Would you like me to now generate a batch evaluation script to process all 5 test cases from the case study PDF and output a table or JSON of results?


You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Edited
✅ The code has been updated to include a batch evaluation that processes all 5 financial news articles from the case study PDF. Each article flows through the full pipeline of agents and prints a structured summary.

Just run the script, and you'll see clear output for each test case. Let me know if you’d like the results saved to a file (CSV/JSON), or need help visualizing the evaluation in a table format!


You said:
add published date and content parameter to exist code

✅ The SummaryInput model and summary output have been updated to include the content and published_at fields. These are now displayed in the final summary for each article.

Let me know if you’d like to export the results to a CSV/JSON file or visualize them in a table!

Edited
✅ The unterminated f-string error has been resolved. The summary output is now properly formatted using multiline f-strings with line breaks (\n), and includes content and published_at.

You're all set to re-run the script. Let me know if you'd like the summaries saved to a file or displayed in a tabular format!

You said:
remove sentiment analysis, affected companies parameters

Failed to edit
I attempted to remove the “Sentiment Analysis” and “Affected Companies” fields from both the SummaryInput model and the printed summary output. The update to the data model succeeded, but the edit to the summary = (...) block failed due to a mismatch in the regular expression format I used for matching multiline f-strings.

I'll now correct this manually. Let me go ahead and directly rewrite the SummaryAgent class and related parts to reflect the changes you requested.

Made 3 edits
✅ The Sentiment Analysis and Affected Companies fields have been successfully removed from the summary section and the SummaryInput model. The summary now only includes:

Headline

Content

Predicted Market Impact

Published At

Let me know if you'd like to simplify further or save the output to a file!
